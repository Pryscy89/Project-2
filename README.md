# Project-2
Your task is to:
(1) Choose any three of the “wide” datasets identified in the Week 5 Discussion items. (You may
use your own dataset; please don’t use my Sample Post dataset, since that was used in your
Project 1 assignment!) For each of the three chosen datasets:
• Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information
included in the dataset. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the
information appears in the discussion item, so that you can practice tidying and
transformations as described below.
• Read the information from your .CSV file into Python, and use pandas as needed to tidy
and transform your data. [Most of your grade will be based on this step!]
• Perform the analysis requested in the discussion item.
• Your code should be in an Jupyter Notebook, posted to your GitHub repository, and
should include narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and
conclusions.
(2) Please include the URL for the Jupyter Notebook in your homework submission, for each of the
three chosen datasets. You may create a single Jupyter Notebook, or three separate notebooks.
